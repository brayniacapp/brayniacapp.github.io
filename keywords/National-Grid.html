            <p>Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions By providing greater access and more charging options, National Grid’s program supports the growth of EV use while balancing the transportation ecosystem, which is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The program also will mitigate climate change, improve air quality, amplify access to cleaner transportation in underserved communities, and reduce our national reliance on petroleum.</p>
