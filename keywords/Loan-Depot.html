            <p>Early Friday morning, the veterans boarded their assigned yachts and began their epic adventure off the pristine waters of Santa Catalina Island, an area considered to be the birthplace of modern sportfishing. Despite the day being a pre-Tournament day of relaxation and bonding, some of the WHOW Tournament teams found themselves in the middle of some early action, notably Team Bull Pen, led by David DuBois, whose group caught a 136 pound striped marlin that afternoon.
