The decrease in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2021, was driven by the decrease in the Company’s share price year-to-date, and the increase in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by the increase in the Company’s share price from its initial public offering in May 2020.</p>
