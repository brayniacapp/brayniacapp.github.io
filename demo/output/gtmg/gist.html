<p> Joubin is a go to market partner at Kleiner Perkins and interviews world class revenue and go-to market leaders to explore how they operate, think and deploy grit every day in order to build incredible companies.

<p> You don't know what you're going to like until you try it. And I think I just grew up trying a lot of different things. As you do things, you get better at prioritizing and getting more efficient so you can take on more.</p>

<p> DB is that your first peer group as a C level executive is the C level executives. It's not your actual team that reports into you. That's your second team. When you align as leaders and you have the same goals and you're lining around the vision, the problems, you work through them. They're tough problems, but you're aligned. You can't have because what happens if you guys are aligned and your team starts to point? Fingers are bigger, it's going to get escalated eventually, and we're going to stop it.</p>

<p> I wanted to be the CMO of Dock Houston, and I didn't get the job. I fought for it during my maternity leave to go be it. I learned a lot in the process. I'm a glass half full, so I'm always seeing the silver lining. It's just how I get through failure. I call it content, indifference towards the decision or agreeing with it. So, I'm kind of a person who tries for a lot of things and I don't get them all. But I have so many things I'm trying for. Like, Okay, I just go. Okay, Well, that was supposed to happen. Now you're really happy with the kids.</p>

<p> Marketing is a bunch of plates spinning in the air because you're doing brand. You're doing product marketing, doing enterprise, building sales decks, you're enabling the field. You've got to balance all that and you're managing a team that is not all the same. It's not like you're an engineer coding something, and everyone watches your code in marketing in marketing. Everything's visual. Everyone's a great marketer, everyone has an opinion. You need to be growing learning, and you've got a competitive landscape.</p>

<p> There is not that much collaboration like don't get me wrong. It's not the same as marketing to get a product out the door as an example, like you close a deal, you can pretty specifically go into the details of that deal or the way you hit your number.</p>

<p> Aaron Carroll: I think he's one of the reasons we came out so strongly out of this is he took us up market to enterprise. Carroll: He was the right hire at the right time, and he came from the PTC grit. He also diversified us into other industries and landed really large deals and really validated us. Carroll says he had to streamline, streamline and streamline the company.</p>
