<li><p> In many ways in 1991 The US was the hyperpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p></li>
<li><p>It was a hyper power that could win everywhere without fighting.</p></li>
<li><p>And in many ways the combination administrations over the last 30 ish years have blown maybe the biggest lead in human history now.</p></li>
<li><p>It fights everywhere without winning.</p></li>

<li><p>Percent of global GDP that's been dropping basically for the last 40 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas India and china's share in particular has been rising you know actually as of 2019 Mckinsey had a report on this but ASIA was more than 50% of GDP I believe By 2019 on certainly p. p.p.</p></li>

<li><p> What's falling a the West is a percentage of GDP, the U.S. Military strength as we just discussed and that some very important topic to discuss further Internal us cohesion and also just the European percentage of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>But all of these institutions that were set up years ago kind of assume Western predominance for example like the United Nations is the US the UK France Russia and china.</p></li>

<li><p> India had been floating like a crypto ban in january thereabouts.</p></li>
<li><p>But now near Mamacita Ramen who's the finance Minister of India has made good comments on this in public.</p></li>
<li><p>And over the last nine months indian crypto is just absolutely exploded.</p></li>
<li><p>There's coin switch slash Uber and a bunch of these exchanges, I won't remember all of them.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> This is related to that N Y T C C C B B T C triangle that we talked about last time which is Whoa Capital.</p></li>
<li><p>Communist capital says you must submit that the Communist Party, they're strong, you're weak, they have power.</p></li>
<li><p>Capital says it is because you are powerful because you're wide or male or straight or says you have or you're rich or something.</p></li>
<li><p>You have power and therefore you must sympathize.</p></li>
<li><p>You must apologize, you must bend your your eyes down, your eyes are downcast, your head is bent but it ends in the same position of submission as Communist capital.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> The woke capital corner of the triangle and N Y T corner is the opposite of sovereignty.</p></li>
<li><p>The opposite of that where nobody submits is san Francisco where you can walk in and they've legalized crime, anything under 9 50 or something, you can chop it from Walgreens.</p></li>
<li><p>You go in and help yourself walk out repeat it.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> We are already in the midst of what we might call reputational civil war in the US which is just going to intensify and it's gonna get a lot worse once we have ai driving additional misinformation and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>It's gonna be a hell of a thing which is not that far off I don't think.</p></li>
<li><p>But where do you see The us going in the next say 3-5 years if we can constrain a little bit because I know it may be easier to go to say 15 directionally.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Bitcoin is moving off exchanges prices, moving up ecosystem, building out having this constraint supply supply the all time high may be just the beginning, which turned out to be true.</p></li>
<li><p>Cryptocurrency is a massively scalable application right to park your money and get money back and defy offers insane interest at very high risk.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put in a million bucks and get like $100,000 a year or more in interest.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> As trust in society decreases, it is harder and harder to maintain a scaled organization of human beings.</p></li>
<li><p>So I think the answer is going to be robotics.</p></li>
<li><p>How do those things relate?</p></li>
<li><p>Well, when you give a robot instructions to go and unpack a box, it just doesn't, there is no divergence between the capitalist and the worker.</p></li>

<li><p>And how do you decide that for yourself?</p></li>

<li><p> Re centralization is like entity unbundle ng re bundling like cDS individual mp three's playlists.</p></li>
<li><p>It is newspapers, individual articles, twitter feeds, It is countries, anarchy, new countries, new cities.</p></li>
<li><p>What is that in Cryptocurrency the re centralization.</p></li>
<li><p>What does the counter decentralization looks like?</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like deplatforming from social media platforms, it looks like one banking, it.</p></li>
<li><p>looks like the chinese surveillance state.</p></li>
<li><p>And the counter.</p></li>
<li><p>decentralization I believe is going to succeed in China and fail in the US.</p></li>

<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> The way that the CCP works is yes, there isn't voting.</p></li>
<li><p>If people want to exercise political power, they join the party sort of like how in the US, yes, you can vote, but if you really want to be politically powerful, you want to run for mayor or something like that.</p></li>
<li><p>That means joining a party.</p></li>
<li><p>It's like a giant corporation where they're looking very much at metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>And the chinese government was always kind of conscious of losing the mandate of heaven and having too much dissatisfaction so that all these polls and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to keep ahead of public sentiment, solve these kinds of problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> The U.S. Government is losing control over both domestic and international affairs.</p></li>
<li><p>States and cities within the U. S. will take positions at variance with the feds because cryptocurrencies coming so valuable to them that they'll have the equivalent of Sanctuary States and Sanctuary cities for crypto.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole pax Americana is based on The repeal of the 10th amendment at home and regulatory harmonization abroad.</p></li>

<li><p> If you had to live in the U.S. where would you live and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Probably florida why?</p></li>
<li><p>Because those are becoming like freedom states.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that those states, it's really like a search engine.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy is not a scalar.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a set of decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy is a vector.</p></li>

<li><p>All the type of stuff of society can run a ton of stuff that it currently does at city hall on a Blockchain.</p></li>

<li><p> Prices don't come from storks they come from this and where does it come from?</p></li>
<li><p>David Obeidallah explains how prices come from interaction of supply and demand.</p></li>
<li><p>He says the current market clearing price is five bucks, but if a lot of people suddenly by and clear out the supply then the next available unit might be at like eight bucks or 10 bucks.</p></li>
<li><p>And conversely demand is sort of lowest at $5 whether it be a ton of demand, there might be lots of people who would buy a gallon of milk for a dollar.</p></li>

<li><p> This is what I call the defi.</p></li>
<li><p>Matrix a digital wallet doesn't just hold Bitcoin it can eventually hold everything you know fiat currencies, ethereum tokens, N. F. T. Is whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>The defi matrix means everything is just getting re priced all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Price discovery and the sort of transparency of order book that you're talking about is right there and then their analytics being built on top of these market places.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> The remote economy has done is it has put Miami in direct competition with san Francisco and poorly managed cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Small countries will see an opportunity here two level up their currencies recognizing that they no longer have a geographical advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>The price of a city, every ideology, everything will have a price which roughly reflects people's measure of belief in it.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> CCP is alienating many of the best from the N. Y. T. T corner of the triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Even the Btc corner, the triangle maximal is.</p></li>
<li><p>alienating people like metallic or zuko or the salon a founders or anybody who wants to innovate on so called L one, they're kind of being pushed away from from that corner.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> The order book is each cell in the T. Five Matrix how that price is determined.</p></li>
<li><p>Bitcoin 100 billion valuation market cap market cap bigger 100 billion is an industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Bitcoin at a trillion is a government.</p></li>
<li><p>Bitcoin at 10 trillion or maybe 100 trillion.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone that range is a world government.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p> 10 sec gritty is a it's a combination of tension and integrity.</p></li>
<li><p>San Francisco was $12 billion 13.7 billion now, it's like probably the worst managed, you can't even call a first world city really anymore that doesn't even apply.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a descending world city.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't use the term developed world in developing world anymore.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> What you really want is not a 51% democracy, you want 100% democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>The 51% may feel like they want to impose their will on the 49% via coercion.</p></li>
<li><p>That's actually bad because it's easy to coerce when it's like.1% of the society.</p></li>
<li><p>When it's.99% of society agreeing that cores of forces legitimate against him.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> There was an article on this in 2018 that actually was artie by both the Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams.</p></li>
<li><p>And essentially they say, remember the great lesson in California, the harbinger of America's political future.</p></li>
<li><p>And essentially what they're basically saying is California is a one party democrat state and that's what you want for the country.</p></li>
<li><p>So then the natural continuum more progressive to more moderate solutions and got worked out within the context of the only remaining functioning party.</p></li>
<li><p>So essentially they're just saying just win.</p></li>
<li><p>And now, of course, it is a question mark as to whether you actually quote, want democracy.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Bitcoin itself will be like the main flashpoint, the conflict in crypto is sort of Bitcoin is different from crypto because maximalist wanted to be different, that is to say whether you think of them, it's kind of like it's Taiwan part of china or is his own country.</p></li>
<li><p>But if you're a maximalist, Bitcoin is its own thing and all crypto is just scams etcetera.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas if you are in crypto or in web three actually, Bitcoin does one thing which is digital gold and then we also need private cash.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Bitcoin will be seen as something like the bible or the Koran or the communist manifesto or the american declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>Satoshi Nakamoto is a really great last name for Satoshi, but I think it's a really important for any language nerds out there for any.</p></li>
<li><p>Nakamoto and the character for naka is the same character different reading as the song of jungles of china, Middle Kingdom.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Bitcoin has become almost like an element like gold.</p></li>
<li><p>It fits a certain kind of mentality where because there's no leader, you don't feel like you're submitting to somebody by buying gold Satoshi is who you make them out to be.</p></li>
<li><p>It's unlikely that there's gonna be a technical attack on Bitcoin going forward is potentially a regulatory or software attack.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> We're kind of running history in reverse at least in the west.</p></li>
<li><p>Peak centralization was 1951 telephone company, A T and T and two superpowers the US and USSR and three Tv stations, abc, cbs and NBC.</p></li>
<li><p>We're lucky that it wasn't spanish flu, fortunately, but it's going to be on the order of 10 million dead.</p></li>
<li><p>The common symptom is this centralized fist clenching in 1950 is now losing control.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> I'm actually most bullish on twitter slash square and facebook and the reason to put them is they're going to become probably merged into something like Square's Bitcoin support and the fact that Jack is ceo of both, of course they're two separate entities but he can figure it out and probably offer Bitcoin payments on twitter for many things.</p></li>
<li><p>There's ways of doing with zero knowledge, there's a number of different engineering trade offs that could be made.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> The internet of money and the internet of information eventually merged together because with something like disco with what was called the cloud body.</p></li>
<li><p>So if you go to their block Explorer you can see that every post and like and so on his own chain and that shows that actually more than just financial data can be represented on chain.</p></li>
<li><p>Social data can pretty much everything else can as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> In some ways there's good and bad, the bad is with the state receding with decentralization, winning the american anarchy that may follow.</p></li>
<li><p>The tyranny doesn't have enough state capacity to sustain for long and that's different than the soviet Ernie Ernie.</p></li>
<li><p>What is scarce is not freedom but leadership that say in a time of tyranny, what scarce freedom is scarce, his leadership.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p> The administration wanted I believe turned the page on this from a pr standpoint and that's why this august announcement was teed up.</p></li>
<li><p>But the problem is though that it actually revealed a bunch of issues first is the fact that is Australia, the UK and the US.</p></li>
<li><p>India and Japan were left out of this.</p></li>
<li><p>And the U. K, which is on the other side of the world was brought in now.</p></li>

<li><p> Media corporations have abandoned many niches.</p></li>
<li><p>Sports Illustrated's not Sports illustrated.</p></li>
<li><p>Teen vogue is not teen vogue.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, if you took these articles, they basically all sound like the same.</p></li>
<li><p>I can't even type stuff and if you just strip the branding and you just had a, I try to distinguish it.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure you could because they're essentially all like on twitter and there are part of the same sort of conformist group now though with sub stack.</p></li>
