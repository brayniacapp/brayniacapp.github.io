<li><p> He was one of these guys you would want it to be, you're gonna, you know, best friend, I looked up to him, I probably wished he was Home more because he was frankly like I became someone who worked a lot.</p></li>

<li><p> Ralph Ellison taught me how to read in a way that I fully didn't understand and I knew that I I loved more than anything the sound of literature.</p></li>
<li><p>He also gave me the confidence to try to be a professional writer, which I proceeded to do for for 20 years was was ralph Ellison.</p></li>

<li><p> Bob Greene met a Rolling Stone writer who asked him to write a story about a dictator in Spain.</p></li>
<li><p>Greene says he had no idea what he wanted to do when he got a telegram saying, go to Spain to cover the funeral of the last dictator of the World War Two era, you know, dictators.</p></li>
<li><p>Greene: I think attacks all people who go way out with crazy ideas, whatever they are, are about to find it out.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Why did you want to write a book about Sears?</p></li>
<li><p>Well, I kind of thought how weird would it be to take this, you know, this hippie counterculture storytelling and write about a big old american company?</p></li>
<li><p>And I wrote another letter, I wrote a letter to the Ceo and chairman of Sears, a guy named Ed telling who was famous for never having given an interview, a completely introverted guy.</p></li>
<li><p>And he just decided that he'd let me in.</p></li>
<li><p>And so I proceeded to show up as a bearded, still looking quite young guy and people who worked at Sears decided I was okay because I had sold at telling on something they never thought anybody would sell it on.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p> I remember thinking if you took these audiobooks, you could actually liberate time for people.</p></li>
<li><p>I remember all these things coming out saying, can't you see it?</p></li>
<li><p>And like people thought I was out of my mind.</p></li>
<li><p>I mean, I couldn't find anybody who knew what I was talking about except for Ed Lau, my college roommate from N. Y. U.</p></li>
<li><p>And I said, head, you know, if you could take audio books and send them through the phone line, the cost of the, of the packaging and all those tapes wouldn't be there.</p></li>
<li><p>You could lower the cost.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> Because you were writing a book, how did this idea just take over your mind and your life?</p></li>
<li><p>Because all of us get ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>We've all had a business idea and sometimes it captures us for a week or two weeks.</p></li>

<li><p> I thought the content would be a mixture of literally the best possible public expression in words.</p></li>
<li><p>You know, if the Churchill club had profound speeches, I wanted to carry that.</p></li>
<li><p>If, uh, if we turned the SAn, Jose Mercury news into an audio program, you have people reading the newspaper as content.</p></li>
<li><p>Well, we got some of your buddies at NPR, so we could have car talk or marketplace, which car talk, which was owned by those guys.</p></li>
<li><p>So you don't have to deal with NPR, by by 99, I'd signed up Robin Williams to do original programming for us.</p></li>

<li><p> Don Katz: Being a public company was not fun.</p></li>
<li><p>He says he was incredibly anxious, but he just kind of had a attitude about it because we weren't out of capital yet, you know, and we had investors who had not given up hope and it felt like there was just another reason to keep fighting but still don't.</p></li>
<li><p>Katz: We decided to not be technology agnostic when we went public.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> It was difficult to bridge a world that is very much not technology focus publishing, no book publishing is is people who love books meaning that they're willing to get paid less or they have the wherewithal to not get paid a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually we did start to break through and be able to carry these audiobooks at a different cost.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> It was 9 95 for two audiobooks and we started a month a month and uh, it gained traction and frankly, the phone call I got around this period from Cupertino California from steve jobs was a ray of hope that was really meaningful.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> We have many, many hundreds of thousands of thousands, obviously 20,000 audiobooks in 2000 and seven and 45,000 other kinds of content including Robin's programs, Ricky Jarvis is programs the amazing Susie Bright erotica series which has had, which was pre podcast before the yes, they were all short form programs.</p></li>

<li><p>We moved in with 100 and 20 people and nobody left.</p></li>
<li><p>Newark venture Partners, which has become an international level of success drawing companies from all over the world to Newark to an accelerator.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> In 2007, your annual revenue at Audible was like $110 million.</p></li>
<li><p>January of 2008 amazon announced that they would acquire audible for $300 million in cash.</p></li>
<li><p>In retrospect, they got a great deal for you, especially given that your revenue was 110 year before.</p></li>
<li><p>But at the time, did you think it was the right move for audible?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li><p> I think it's something on the order of 55.5 to 51%  purposeful, good calls and brave moments and, and times when you just didn't give up the rest of it is definitely luck because otherwise how could I have made so many stupid, boneheaded decisions along the way that didn't kill us?</p></li>
</ul>
